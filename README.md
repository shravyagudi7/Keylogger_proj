# Basic Keylogger

This code snippet demonstrates how to create a basic keylogger using the pynput library. The keylogger captures both alphanumeric and special keys, writes them to a log file (log.txt), and prints information about the pressed keys. Remember that using keyloggers without proper authorization is unethical and potentially illegal. Always respect privacy and legal boundaries when working with such tools. üòä




## Features

- Captures both alphanumeric and special keys.
- Writes keystrokes to a log file (log.txt).
- Prints information about the pressed keys to the console.


## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website: Python Downloads

how to install python on your system 
- step by step instructions

### 1. Download Python:

- Head over to the official Python website: Python Downloads.
- Click on the download link for the latest version of Python compatible with Windows 11.
- The installer file will start downloading.
### 2. Run the Installer:
- Locate the downloaded installer file (usually named python-3.x.x.exe).
- Double-click the file to run the Python installer.
You might see a security prompt asking if you‚Äôre sure you want to run the file. Click ‚ÄòYes‚Äô to proceed.

### 3. Customize Installation (Optional):
- The installer window will open, presenting several options.
- You can choose to customize your Python installation by clicking the ‚ÄòCustomize installation‚Äô button. 
- However, sticking with the default settings is safe for most users.
### 4. Begin the Installation:
- Click the ‚ÄòInstall Now‚Äô button to start the installation process.
- The installer will show you the progress as Python is installed on your Windows 11 machine.
- Be patient; this might take a few minutes.
### 5. Verify the Installation:
- Open the Command Prompt (search for ‚Äúcmd‚Äù in the Start menu).
- Type python and press Enter.
- If Python is installed correctly, you‚Äôll see the Python version number and a prompt where you can start typing Python code.

### Remember these tips:

Always download Python from the official website to ensure you‚Äôre getting the legitimate version.
Check the box that says ‚ÄúAdd Python to PATH‚Äù during installation for easier command-line access.
## Installation

Clone this repository or download the ZIP file.
Navigate to the project directory.
## Usage
### Running the Keylogger


1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the project directory where `keylogger.py` is located.
4. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python keylogger.py

5. The keylogger will start capturing keystrokes.
6. Press the Escape key (Esc) to stop the keylogger.
7. The logged keystrokes will be saved in log.txt




## Security Consideration's: 

#### Authorization and Consent: 
Always obtain proper authorization before deploying a keylogger. Inform users explicitly that their keystrokes will be logged and obtain their consent.
#### Secure File Storage: 
Consider encrypting the log data or storing it securely.
#### Obfuscate the Code:
Minimize the risk of detection by obfuscating the keylogger code.
#### Limit Privileges:
Run the keylogger with minimal privileges.
#### Educate Users: 
If used for legitimate purposes, educate users about its purpose and assure them that sensitive information won‚Äôt be misused.
